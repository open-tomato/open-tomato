/**
 * Builds a `ClientsMap` from a list of `TypedClient` instances.
 *
 * The map uses referential identity to look up clients — callers must pass the
 * same object reference that was provided to `createService`.
 *
 * @param clients - The typed client instances registered with the service.
 * @returns A `ClientsMap` whose `get` returns the client's proxy surface directly.
 *
 * @remarks Unlike `DepsMap`, which unwraps `.client` from a `TypedDependency`,
 * `ClientsMap.get` returns the `TypedClient` itself — the proxy surface is the client.
