/**
 * Creates and auto-starts an MCP server from the provided configuration.
 *
 * The server starts immediately upon calling this function — no explicit
 * `start()` call is needed. It progresses through five lifecycle phases:
 *
 * **1. Init** — `config` is validated and defaulted via `MCPConfigSchema`.
 * A scoped logger is created from `serviceId` and the optional `logger` config.
 * The `clients` array is indexed into a `ClientsMap` keyed by each client's
 * `name` property (set when the client was constructed via `createHttpClient`).
 *
 * **2. Setup** — `config.setup(server, ctx)` is awaited. Register all tools,
 * resources, and prompts here. If this callback throws or rejects, the factory
 * logs the error and exits the process — the health server is never started.
 *
 * **3. Transport** — the transport is selected based on the `MCP_TRANSPORT`
 * environment variable:
 * - _(default)_ `MCP_TRANSPORT` unset or any value other than `'stdio'`:
 *   `WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport` in stateful mode
 *   (`sessionIdGenerator: () => randomUUID()`), listening on `PORT` (default
 *   `8080`). Stateless mode is intentionally avoided — it breaks the MCP
 *   `initialize` handshake which requires at least two HTTP round-trips.
 * - `MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio`: `StdioServerTransport` for local dev and Claude
 *   Desktop integration. The health server is **not** started in this mode.
 *
 * **4. Health** _(HTTP mode only)_ — a lightweight `node:http` server starts on
 * `health.port` (default `3001`) at `health.path` (default `'/health'`).
 * The response aggregates circuit-breaker states from all registered clients:
 * `"ok"` when all circuits are closed, `"degraded"` when any circuit is open or
 * half-open, `"error"` when the MCP transport itself has failed.
 *
 * **5. SIGTERM** — a one-time `SIGTERM` handler is registered _before_
 * `start()` is invoked so that signals received during the async setup phase
 * are still caught. On signal: the MCP transport is closed (draining in-flight
 * requests), then the health server is stopped. Both steps use optional
 * chaining so they are safe no-ops if startup had not yet reached those phases.
 *
 * **`clients` key caveat** — keys in `MCPContext.clients` are the `name` values
 * set on each `TypedClient` at construction time (e.g. `'github-api'`), not
 * positional indices. Accessing a client by the wrong name returns `undefined`.
 * Use {@link ClientsMap} helpers or store a direct reference to avoid typos.
 *
 * @param config - MCP server configuration. See {@link MCPConfig} for details.
 * @returns An {@link MCPHandle} with `stop()` and `healthUrl()` methods.
 *
 * @example Minimal — no clients
 * ```ts
 * const handle = createMCP({
 *   serviceId: 'my-mcp',
 *   setup: async (server, { logger }) => {
 *     server.tool('greet', {}, async () => ({ content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Hello!' }] }));
 *   },
 * });
 *
 * // In tests or on SIGTERM:
 * await handle.stop();
 * ```
 *
 * @example With an HTTP client
 * ```ts
 * const github = createHttpClient(new GitHubApi(), { retry: { attempts: 2 } });
 *
 * const handle = createMCP({
 *   serviceId: 'context-generator',
 *   clients: [github],
 *   setup(server, { clients }) {
 *     // Access by the client's `name` property, not by index.
 *     const gh = clients['github-api'] as GitHubApi;
 *     server.tool('get-repo', GetRepoSchema, async ({ owner, repo }) => {
 *       const data = await gh.getRepo(owner, repo);
 *       return { content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify(data) }] };
 *     });
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
