# Open Tomato

Primary application monorepo — four backend services (`notifications`, `orchestrator`, `scheduler`, `task-worker`) plus the `app/` frontend, orchestrated with Bun and Turborepo.

Shared libraries, the CLI, and service templates live in sibling repos under the umbrella directory. This repo depends on them via `file:` references during the split; once packages are published to the npm org, those references switch to semver ranges.

## Name conventions

- **"Monorepo"** — this repository (`open-tomato/`).
- **"Project"** — an individual service or app within this monorepo.
- **"App"** — the frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript), under `app/`.
- **"Services"** — backend projects (typically Express-based), under `services/`.
- **"Types"** — repo-level shared TypeScript types, under `types/`.
- **"Packages"** — shared libraries consumed as deps; they live in the sibling [`../packages/`](../packages/) repo.

## Quick start

```bash
bun install           # resolves file: references to ../packages/shared/*
bun run build         # turbo: build every workspace
bun run test          # turbo: run every workspace test
bun lint              # turbo: lint every workspace
bun run dev:stack     # docker compose up --build (full dev constellation)
```

Individual workspace scripts are runnable via turbo filters:

```bash
bun run dev --filter @open-tomato/app        # only the frontend
bun run test --filter @open-tomato/notifications
```
